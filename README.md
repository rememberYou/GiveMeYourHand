# GiveMeYourHand

GiveMeYourHand is a project made with Laravel, involved the creation of a website whose purpose
is to help people in psychological difficulties and/or to achieve their goals.

The project is made open-source, because the website isn't active anymore. 

Feel free to use the code for your own Laravel websites.

If you wish create a new project with the same idea and need people to work on
it, you can contact me on this address: terencio.agozzino@gmail.com
